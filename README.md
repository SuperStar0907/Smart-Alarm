# Smart-Alarm
A IOT based project of smart alarm based on the distance of hand from the alarm.


    The main motivation for this project was that we always use alarm clocks especially students having exams and deadlines . But we don’t
    want to get up and stop it or we don’t want to do any work to snooze it . 
    So we thought we might be helpful to those people wanting to switch off the alarm or snooze it from the same place they are without touching the alarm clock .
    The main idea now to develop such alarm clock is to use our hand and the distance between hand and alarm clock to snooze or stop the clock .
